    The layers of networking! It's like a delicious layer cake with each slice representing a different aspect of communication between clients and servers. Let's take a mouthwatering journey through these layers:
    <br>
    <br>
    1. The Application Layer:
    <br>
       This is the top layer of our networking cake, where the actual applications reside. It's like the frosting
        on the cake, providing the sweet goodness. Here, clients and servers interact through specific protocols 
        like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for emails,
        or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file sharing. It's all about enabling high-level application functionalities.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. The Presentation Layer:
    <br>
    In cake this is like how nicely it is packed and deleivered.
    The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. 
    It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on the other end. 
    The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over 
    the session layer.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. The Session Layer:
    <br>
    It is like delivery partner to deliver the cake
    The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices. 
    It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred,
     and closing them when communication ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transferâ€”if 
     the session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint.
    <br>
    <br>
    4. The Transport Layer:
    <br>
       Moving down the cake, we reach the transport layer, like a layer of fluffy sponge cake. This layer ensures 
       that data is transmitted reliably and efficiently between the client and server. It uses protocols like TCP 
       (Transmission Control Protocol) that breaks the data into manageable chunks, ensures their delivery, and 
       guarantees that they arrive in the correct order. It's like the reliable courier service of our networking cake.
    <br>
    <br>
    5. The Network Layer:
    <br>
       Going deeper, we find the network layer, which is like a layer of delicious jam. It handles the 
       addressing and routing of data packets across different networks. It uses the IP (Internet Protocol) 
       to assign unique IP addresses to devices, allowing them to find their way in the vast network. It's like the 
       roadmap that guides our data packets to their destinations.
    <br>
    <br>
    6. The Data Link Layer:
    <br>
       Descending further, we reach the data link layer, akin to a layer of moist cake. This layer deals 
       with the physical transmission of data over a specific medium, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. It takes the 
       data packets from the network layer and encapsulates them into frames, adding physical addresses (MAC addresses) 
       to ensure the correct delivery within the local network. It's like the conveyor belt that safely transports our
       precious cake layers.
    <br>
    <br>
    7. The Physical Layer:
    <br>
       Finally, we arrive at the bottom layer, the physical layer, which is like the sturdy cake plate that 
       holds everything together. This layer deals with the actual transmission of raw bits over physical mediums, 
       such as copper wires, fiber optics, or radio waves. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and functional 
       characteristics of the hardware involved in data transmission.
    <br>
    <br>
    So, imagine this networking cake, with each layer playing a crucial role in the communication between clients 
    and servers. From the sweet frosting of applications to the solid foundation of physical transmission, these 
    layers work together to ensure a delectable networking experience.

<p class="alert alert-primary mt-5">
    The network layers are a framework that helps to understand complex network interactions. 
    There are two models that are widely referenced today: OSI and TCP/IP. The concepts are similar,
     but the layers themselves differ between the two models. The OSI model describes seven layers that 
     computer systems use to communicate over a network, while the TCP/IP model has four layers. 
     Both models have a physical layer, data link layer, network layer, and transport layer. The OSI model also has a 
     session layer, presentation layer, and application layer, while the TCP/IP model combines the session, 
     presentation, and application layers into one layer called the application layer. On the client side, the 
     application layer is responsible for interacting with the user and providing services such as email or web browsing. 
     On the server side, the application layer is responsible for providing services such as file sharing or web hosting.
      The transport layer is responsible for ensuring reliable data transfer between applications on different devices.
       The network layer is responsible for routing data between different networks. Finally, the physical layer is 
       responsible for transmitting raw data over a physical medium such as copper wire or fiber optic cable.
